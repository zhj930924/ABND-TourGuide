    <string name="bund_review">A must-do. I’ve been to Shanghai many times and never saw it and
        it made me have a new perspective on the city. I saw during the day, but assume night
        time would have a whole different feel. Enjoy!

    <!-- Yu Garden -->

    <string name="yu_garden_review">My wife who is an avid gardener was blow away by the size and variety within the walls. 
	There is a 60 RMB ticket price to get it but it is well worth the price. Our visit was on a July afternoon so it was very hot 
	and humid. Plan ahead as 4 hours is a minimum to enjoy the entire gardens and taking time to stop for pictures and read the 
	history. There are shops within the walls selling cheap to very expensive souvenirs but the quality is much better than those 
	at the exit.
